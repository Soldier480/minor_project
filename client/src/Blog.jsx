        <p className="mb-4 ">
          Finance management forms the bedrock of sound financial planning, encompassing budgeting, saving, spending, and investing strategies. At its core, finance management is about optimizing the allocation of resources to achieve long-term financial goals while maintaining financial stability in the present.

                Importance of Investment Awareness
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-black-700 dark:text-black-300">
                Investment awareness refers to having knowledge about various
                investment options, their risks, and potential returns. It

                allocate their funds and how to diversify their investment
                portfolio. Without investment awareness, individuals may fall
                prey to scams or make poor investment choices that could lead
                to financial losses.
